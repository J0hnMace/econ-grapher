# Economics Graph Generator

Economics Graph Generator is a JavaScript webapp that can create and analyze basic linear functions, geared towards IB Economics. It generates easily screenshot-able graphs, complete with Graph Titles, Axis Titles, Axis Labelling, and even more (coming soon). 

Some example usages of our software include:

* Linear Supply/Demand Functions
* Graphing Market Equillibrium


We used [charts.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).
